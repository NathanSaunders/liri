# LIRI Bot

## Overview

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters that search 'Spotify' for songs, 'Bands in Town' for concerts, and 'OMDB' for movies and provides the requested data.

### How it works

Using specific commands in the node app will return information collected from the API and return the data to your terminal. `spotify-this-song` Spotify, Bands In Town and OMDB
